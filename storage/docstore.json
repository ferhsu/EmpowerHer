Countess of Lovelace, was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation.\nAda Byron was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and reformer Lady Byron. All Lovelace's half-siblings, Lord Byron's other children, were born out of wedlock to other women. Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever. He died in Greece when Ada was eight. Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived insanity. Despite this, Ada remained interested in him, naming her two sons Byron and Gordon. Upon her death, she was buried next to him at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.\n\nHer educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Charles Babbage, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday, and the author Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as \"poetical science\" and herself as an \"Analyst (& Metaphysician)\".\n\nWhen she was eighteen, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, who is known as \"the father of computers\". She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, Mary Somerville.\n\nBetween 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by the military engineer Luigi Menabrea (later Prime Minister of Italy) about the Analytical Engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of seven notes, simply called \"Notes\".\n\nLovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers, especially since the seventh one contained what many consider to be the first computer program\u2014that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbage's personal notes from the years 1836/1837 contain the first programs for the engine.[better source needed] She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities. Her mindset of \"poetical science\" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "507886a3-0c1c-403c-9dc8-b1a8548ff363": {"__data__": {"id_": "507886a3-0c1c-403c-9dc8-b1a8548ff363", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/blancatrevino.txt", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fb62521a-5215-4a9d-943b-435b360e80bc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/blancatrevino.txt", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-10"}, "hash": "6f939a937d9528ec91c5c7dbd4412bd67e96139566dbc82f499ff1e82e1921b7"}}, "hash": "6f939a937d9528ec91c5c7dbd4412bd67e96139566dbc82f499ff1e82e1921b7", "text": "Blanca Avelina Trevi\u00f1o de Vega (Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Mexico) is a woman and a president and executive director of Softtek, a Mexican information and communication technologies company, the largest independent service provider in Latin America.\nTrevi\u00f1o earned her bachelor's in 1981 in computer systems administration at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Studies, Monterrey Campus. At first, she regretted choosing the major, as all her classmates were men and she was intimidated. However, her father had already started to brag about how his daughter was studying the then new field and told her that he could not accept a daughter who was afraid. So, she stuck with it.\nA part-time job at Alfa, one of Monterrey's biggest companies, convinced her to think bigger. When the company downsized and laid her off, the idea to form her own company emerged. In 1982, she co-founded Softtek with $10,000 and nine partners, who dreamed of having a global enterprise. It has since grown to have more than 12,000 employees, and thirty offices in Latin America, Europe and Asia. Softtek also has major centers in Monterrey, Ensenada, Aguascalientes and Mexico City in Mexico as well as in Sao Paulo, Brazil; La Coru\u00f1a, Spain; Wuxi, China; La Plata, Argentina; Bogot\u00e1, Colombia; Dallas, TX; and Bangalore, India. The company's presence in the United States came through a Trevi\u00f1o initiative called \"Near shore\" to provide outsourcing, taking advantage of Mexico's geographic proximity.\nSince 2000, she has been the general director of the company and the president of the executive board. Previously, she held positions as \"team leader,\" vice president of sales and marketing as well as general director of operations in the United States.\nCurrently, Softtek has over a thousand computer professionals who provide services to the United States. In 2009, CNN Expansi\u00f3n magazine named her as one of the 50 most powerful women in Mexico, ranking her fourth. In 2011, the Endeavor organization for the development of new entrepreneurs also recognized her career in this field.\nTrevi\u00f1o was the first woman to be inducted into the \"Outsourcing Hall of Fame\"of the International Association of Outsourcing (IAOP).\nIn 2014, she was the first woman to be included in the Consejo Mexicano de Negocios, which caused them to change their name from Consejo Mexicano de Hombres de Negocios. In 2018, Educando (formerly Worldfund) recognized Blanca with the \"Education Leadership Award\" for her contributions and influence in improving education in Mexico.

One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first linkers. Hopper was the first to devise the theory of machine-independent programming languages, and the FLOW-MATIC programming language she created using this theory was later extended to create COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today.\n\nPrior to joining the Navy, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in both mathematics and mathematical physics from Yale University and was a professor of mathematics at Vassar College. Hopper attempted to enlist in the Navy during World War II but was rejected because she was 34 years old. She instead joined the Navy Reserves, leaving her position at Vassar. Hopper began her computing career in 1944 when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team led by Howard H. Aiken. In 1949, she joined the Eckert\u2013Mauchly Computer Corporation and was part of the team that developed the UNIVAC I computer. At Eckert\u2013Mauchly she managed the development of one of the first COBOL compilers. She believed that programming should be simplified with an English-based computer programming language. Her compiler converted English terms into machine code understood by computers. By 1952, Hopper had finished her program linker (originally called a compiler), which was written for the A-0 System. During her wartime service, she co-authored three papers based on her work on the Harvard Mark 1. She is accredited with writing the first computer manual, \u201cA Manual of Operation for the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator.\u201d\n\nIn 1954, Eckert\u2013Mauchly chose Hopper to lead their department for automatic programming, and she led the release of some of the first compiled languages like FLOW-MATIC. In 1959, she participated in the CODASYL consortium, which consulted Hopper to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming language. This led to the COBOL language, which was inspired by her idea of a language being based on English words. Hopper promoted use of the language throughout the 60s. In 1966, she retired from the Naval Reserve, but in 1967 the Navy recalled her to active duty. She retired from the Navy in 1986 and found work as a consultant for the Digital Equipment Corporation, sharing her computing experiences.\n\nThe U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Hopper was named for her, as was the Cray XE6 \"Hopper\" supercomputer at NERSC. During her lifetime, Hopper was awarded 40 honorary degrees from universities across the world. A college at Yale University was renamed in her honor. In 1991, she received the National Medal of Technology. On November 22, 2016, she was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.\n\nGrace Brewster Murray was born in New York City. She was the eldest of three children. Her parents, Walter Fletcher Murray and Mary Campbell Van Horne, were of Scottish and Dutch descent, and attended West End Collegiate Church. Her great-grandfather, Alexander Wilson Russell, an admiral in the US Navy, fought in the Battle of Mobile Bay during the Civil War.\u200a\n\nGrace was very curious as a child; this was a lifelong trait. At the age of seven, she decided to determine how an alarm clock worked and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother realized what she was doing (she was then limited to one clock). Later in life, she was known for keeping a clock that ran backward, she explained, \u201cHumans are allergic to change. They love to say, \u2018We\u2019ve always done it this way.\u2019 I try to fight that. That\u2019s why I have a clock on my wall that runs counterclockwise.\u201d For her preparatory school education, she attended the Hartridge School in Plainfield, New Jersey. Grace was initially rejected for early admission to Vassar College at age 16 (because her test scores in Latin were too low), but she was admitted the following year. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar in 1928 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics and earned her master's degree at Yale University in 1930.\n\nIn 1930, Grace Murray married New York University professor Vincent Foster Hopper (1906\u20131976); they divorced in 1945. She did not marry again and retained his surname.\n\nIn 1934, Hopper earned a Ph.D.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "04385aab-ab4a-45d2-a769-75a02ffb7e55": {"__data__": {"id_": "04385aab-ab4a-45d2-a769-75a02ffb7e55", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/gracehopper.txt", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1b25d80c-b563-4c3a-bc90-3d01b1c540d3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/gracehopper.txt", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-10"}, "hash": "8f0ab4d441bccfac981a1ea86c15a0556f57f45861ca0c59ff0fe417682719c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "1aee53a7-2551-42a3-9454-d6d4804691bf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/gracehopper.txt", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-10"}, "hash": "3c138d252d6e392bd2a1a315dea54aea338ae7f9ee01ed52014b39890d8c99f4"}}, "hash": "5863d9ec9315841bb15df6b40cc02c8c487a2d6260ffea70b53df877705f8324", "text": "In 1934, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale under the direction of \u00d8ystein Ore.

The other five ENIAC programmers were Betty Holberton, Ruth Teitelbaum, Kathleen Antonelli, Marlyn Meltzer, and Frances Spence. Bartik and her colleagues developed and codified many of the fundamentals of programming while working on the ENIAC, since it was the first computer of its kind.\n\nAfter her work on ENIAC, Bartik went on to work on BINAC and UNIVAC, and spent time at a variety of technical companies as a writer, manager, engineer and programmer. She spent her later years as a real estate agent and died in 2011 from congestive heart failure complications.\n\nContent-management framework Drupal's default theme, Bartik, is named in her honor.\nBorn Betty Jean Jennings in Gentry County, Missouri in 1924, she was the sixth of seven children. Her father, William Smith Jennings (1893\u20131971) was from Alanthus Grove, where he was a schoolteacher as well as a farmer. Her mother, Lula May Spainhower (1887\u20131988) was from Alanthus. Jennings had three older brothers, William (January 10, 1915) Robert (March 15, 1918); and Raymond (January 23, 1922); two older sisters, Emma (August 11, 1916) and Lulu (August 22, 1919), and one younger sister, Mable (December 15, 1928).\n\nIn her childhood, she would ride on horseback to visit her grandmother, who bought the young girl a newspaper to read every day and became a role model for the rest of her life. She began her education at a local one-room school, and gained local attention for her softball skill. In order to attend high school, she lived with her older sister in the neighboring town, where the school was located, and then began to drive every day despite being only 14. She graduated from Stanberry High School in 1941, aged 16. She was given the title of salutatorian on her graduation.\n\nShe attended Northwest Missouri State Teachers College now known Northwest Missouri State University, majoring in mathematics with a minor in English and graduated in 1945. Jennings was awarded the only mathematics degree in her class. Although she had originally intended to study journalism, she decided to change to mathematics because she had a bad relationship with her adviser. Later in her life, she earned a master's degree in English at the University of Pennsylvania in 1967 and was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Northwest Missouri State University in 2002.\nStarting in 1996, once the importance of their role in the development of computing was re-discovered, Bartik along with Betty Holberton and Bartik's other friend of over 60 years Kathleen Antonelli (ENIAC programmer and wife of ENIAC co-inventor John Mauchly) began to finally receive the acknowledgement and honors for their pioneering work in the early field of computing. Bartik and Antonelli became invited speakers both at home and abroad to share their experiences working with the ENIAC, BINAC and UNIVAC. Bartik especially went on to receive many honors and awards for her pioneering role programming the ENIAC, BINAC and UNIVAC, the latter of which helped to launch the commercial computer industry, and for turning the ENIAC into the world's first stored program computer.\n\nIn 2010, a documentary Top Secret Rosies: The Female \"Computers\" of WWII was released. The film centered around in-depth interviews of three of the six women programmers, focusing on the commendable patriotic contributions they made during World War II. The ENIAC was responsible for calculating bullet trajectories during the war.\n\nThe ENIAC team is also the subject of the 2013 short documentary film The Computers. This documentary, created by Kathy Kleiman and the ENIAC Programmers Project, combines actual footage of the ENIAC team from the 1940s with interviews with the female team members as they reflect on their time working together on the ENIAC. The Computers is the first part of a three-part documentary series, titled Great Unsung Women of Computing: The Computers, The Coders, and The Future Makers.\n\nBartik wrote her autobiography Pioneer Programmer: Jean Jennings Bartik and the Computer that Changed the World prior to her death in 2011 with the help of long-time colleagues, Dr. Jon T.

Born in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, in 1918, her intense curiosity and brilliance with numbers vaulted her ahead several grades in school. By 13, she was attending the high school on the campus of historically black West Virginia State College. At 18, she enrolled in the college itself, where she made quick work of the school\u2019s math curriculum and found a mentor in math professor W. W. Schieffelin Claytor, the third African American to earn a PhD in mathematics. She graduated with highest honors in 1937 and took a job teaching at a black public school in Virginia.  \n\nWhen West Virginia decided to quietly integrate its graduate schools in 1939, West Virginia State\u2019s president, Dr. John W. Davis, selected her and two men to be the first black students offered spots at the state\u2019s flagship school, West Virginia University. She left her teaching job and enrolled in the graduate math program. At the end of the first session, however, she decided to leave school to start a family with her first husband, James Goble.  She returned to teaching when her three daughters got older, but it wasn\u2019t until 1952 that a relative told her about open positions at the all-black West Area Computing section at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics\u2019 (NACA\u2019s) Langley laboratory, headed by fellow West Virginian Dorothy Vaughan. Katherine and her husband decided to move the family to Newport News, Virginia, to pursue the opportunity, and Katherine began work at Langley in the summer of 1953. Just two weeks into her tenure in the office, Dorothy Vaughan assigned her to a project in the Maneuver Loads Branch of the Flight Research Division, and Katherine\u2019s temporary position soon became permanent. She spent the next four years analyzing data from flight tests and worked on the investigation of a plane crash caused by wake turbulence. As she was wrapping up this work her husband died of cancer in December 1956.\n\nThe 1957 launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik changed history\u2014and Johnson\u2019s life. In 1957, she provided some of the math for the 1958 document Notes on Space Technology, a compendium of a series of 1958 lectures given by engineers in the Flight Research Division and the Pilotless Aircraft Research Division (PARD). Engineers from those groups formed the core of the Space Task Group, the NACA\u2019s first official foray into space travel. Johnson, who had worked with many of them since coming to Langley, \u201ccame along with the program\u201d as the NACA became NASA later that year. She did trajectory analysis for Alan Shepard\u2019s May 1961 mission Freedom 7, America\u2019s first human spaceflight. In 1960, she and engineer Ted Skopinski coauthored Determination of Azimuth Angle at Burnout for Placing a Satellite Over a Selected Earth Position, a report laying out the equations describing an orbital spaceflight in which the landing position of the spacecraft is specified. It was the first time a woman in the Flight Research Division had received credit as an author of a research report.\n\nIn 1962, as NASA prepared for the orbital mission of John Glenn, Johnson was called upon to do the work that she would become most known for. The complexity of the orbital flight had required the construction of a worldwide communications network, linking tracking stations around the world to IBM computers in Washington, Cape Canaveral in Florida, and Bermuda. The computers had been programmed with the orbital equations that would control the trajectory of the capsule in Glenn\u2019s Friendship 7 mission from liftoff to splashdown, but the astronauts were wary of putting their lives in the care of the electronic calculating machines, which were prone to hiccups and blackouts.

She has been called \"the most famous 19th-century woman inventor\". She founded the Eastern Paper Bag Company in 1870, creating paper bags for groceries similar in form to the ones that would be used in later generations. Knight received dozens of patents in different fields, and became a symbol for women's empowerment.\nMargaret E. Knight was born in York, Maine on February 14, 1838, to Hannah Teal and James Knight. As a little girl, \u201cMattie,\u201d as her parents and friends nicknamed her, preferred to play with woodworking tools instead of dolls, stating that \u201cthe only things [she] wanted were a jack knife, a gimlet, and pieces of wood.\u201d She was known as a child for her kites and sleds.\n\nKnight and her brothers, Charlie and Jim, were raised by their widowed mother; Knight's father died when she was young, after which the impoverished family moved to Manchester, New Hampshire, where employment was available in the cotton mills. Any formal education she had was limited to secondary school, as she left to work in the mills at age 12 with her siblings.\n\n12-year-old Knight witnessed an accident at the mill in which a worker was stabbed by a steel-tipped shuttle that shot out of a mechanical loom. Within weeks she invented a safety device for the loom, which was later adopted by other Manchester mills. The device was never patented and its exact nature is unknown, though it may have been either a device to stop the loom when the shuttle thread broke or a guard to physically block a flying shuttle.\n\nHealth problems precluded Knight from continuing to work at the cotton mill. In her teens and early 20s she held several jobs, including in home repair, daguerreotype photography, engraving, and furniture upholstery.\nKnight's first patent, issued in 1870, was for an \"improvement in paper-feeding machines\", a \"pneumatic paper-feeder\" with applications in printing presses and paper-folding machines; her paper bag machine would feature a three-step folding process in forming the flat bottom. At the time, many female inventors and writers concealed their gender by using only an initial instead of their given name, but Margaret E. Knight is clearly identified in this patent.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1a140bc3-c779-40eb-9b40-d6107c9f2735": {"__data__": {"id_": "1a140bc3-c779-40eb-9b40-d6107c9f2735", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/padmasreewarrior.txt", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12ec420c-0959-4740-867d-24ec052bff30", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/padmasreewarrior.txt", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-10"}, "hash": "a9739081901e60526e258d0a215bf45af56df8cc5aeaa98dccbe87f8e3e1a602"}}, "hash": "a9739081901e60526e258d0a215bf45af56df8cc5aeaa98dccbe87f8e3e1a602", "text": "Padmasree Warrior (born Yellepeddi Padmasree) is an Indian-American woman, businesswoman and technology executive.

She is a major figure in assembling the networks and technology to enable what we now know as the internet. She is most famous for her invention of the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), which is fundamental to the operation of network bridges, while working for Digital Equipment Corporation, thus earning her nickname \"Mother of the Internet\". Her innovations have made a huge impact on how networks self-organize and move data. She also made large contributions to many other areas of network design and standardization: for example, enabling today's link-state routing protocols, to be more robust, scalable, and easy to manage.\n\nPerlman was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2015 for contributions to Internet routing and bridging protocols. She holds over 100 issued patents. She was elected to the Internet Hall of Fame in 2014, and to the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2016. She received lifetime achievement awards from USENIX in 2006 and from the Association for Computing Machinery\u2019s SIGCOMM in 2010.\n\nMore recently she has invented the TRILL protocol to correct some of the shortcomings of spanning trees, allowing Ethernet to make optimal use of bandwidth. As of 2022, she was a Fellow at Dell Technologies.\n\nPerlman was born in 1951, Portsmouth, Virginia. She grew up in Loch Arbour, New Jersey. She is Jewish. Both of her parents worked as engineers for the US government. Her father worked on radar and her mother was a mathematician by training who worked as a computer programmer. During her school years Perlman found math and science to be \u201ceffortless and fascinating\u201d, but had no problem achieving top grades in other subjects as well. She enjoyed playing the piano and French horn. While her mother helped her with her math homework, they mainly talked about literature and music. But she didn't feel like she fit underneath the stereotype of an \"engineer\" as she did not break apart computer parts.\n\nDespite being the best science and math student in her school it was only when Perlman took a programming class in high school that she started to consider a career that involved computers. She was the only woman in the class and later reflected \"I was not a hands-on type person. It never occurred to me to take anything apart. I assumed I'd either get electrocuted, or I'd break something\". She graduated from Ocean Township High School in 1969.\nAs an undergraduate at MIT Perlman learned programming for a physics class. She was given her first paid job in 1971 as part-time programmer for the LOGO Lab at the (then) MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, programming system software such as debuggers. \n\nWorking under the supervision of Seymour Papert, she developed a child-friendly version of the educational robotics language LOGO, called TORTIS (\"Toddler's Own Recursive Turtle Interpreter System\"). During research performed in 1974\u201376, young children\u2014the youngest aged 3\u00bd years, programmed a LOGO educational robot called a Turtle. Perlman has been described as a pioneer of teaching young children computer programming. Afterwards, she was inspired to make a new programming language that would teach much younger children similar to Logo, but using special \"keyboards\" and input devices. This project was abandoned because \"being the only woman around, I wanted to be taken seriously as a 'scientist' and was a little embarrassed that my project involved cute little kids\". MIT media project later tracked her down and told her that she started a new field called tangible user interface from the leftovers of her abandoned project.  As a math grad at MIT she needed to find an adviser for her thesis, and joined the MIT group at BBN Technologies. There she first got involved with designing network protocols. Perlman obtained a B.S. and M.S. in Mathematics and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from MIT in 1988. Her doctoral thesis on routing in environments where malicious network failures are present serves as the basis for much of the work that now exists in this area.\nWhen studying at MIT in the late 60s she was one among the 50 or so women students, in a class of about 1,000 students. To begin with MIT only had one women\u2019s dorm, limiting the number of women students that could study. When the men\u2019s dorms at MIT became coed Perlman moved out of the women\u2019s dorm into a mixed dorm, where she became the \"resident female\". She later said that she was so used to the gender imbalance, that it became normal. Only when she saw other women students among a crowd of men she noticed that \"it kind of looked weird\".", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3462c81-c8d4-4294-b045-7f7c277b12a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "e3462c81-c8d4-4294-b045-7f7c277b12a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/robinmaxkii.txt", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a783ab12-0b32-4067-b4b7-c279ca2a027a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/robinmaxkii.txt", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-10"}, "hash": "dc871a4a8362d63f0c570c85b8a6c9ecb12af5f12e4e70e7e9c75ef1bb5f0c69"}}, "hash": "dc871a4a8362d63f0c570c85b8a6c9ecb12af5f12e4e70e7e9c75ef1bb5f0c69", "text": "Robin Maxkii (born November 8, 1990) is a Native American woman, technology activist, filmmaker, and writer.
